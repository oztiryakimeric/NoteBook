This is the course project of CS392 - iOS Programming course which is given in spring 16-17 at Ozyegin University. I got 97 point 
out 100 from this project. The main idea of that application is to allow students to share or find class materials such as notes 
that they take in class.

The backend is written with python. I used django and django rest framework. Application part was written with swift as you can guess.

This project was made for educational purposes, so you might come across ridiculous things:)
